# Beta-Bank-Supervised-Machine-Learning
Write prediction code for when a customer is likely to leave a bank based on customer history

🏦 Predicting Customer Churn at Beta Bank
Every lost customer is a missed opportunity. At Beta Bank, churn had been quietly rising—management knew retaining existing clients was more cost-effective than attracting new ones, but lacked the data tools to act decisively.

This project was designed to change that. Using historical customer data, we built and optimized a machine learning pipeline to predict which customers are at risk of leaving, with a target F1 score of at least 0.59. The final model—trained with downsampling to correct class imbalance—achieved an F1 score of 0.62 on the test set.

The work included:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of 10,000 European customers

Preprocessing including imputation, encoding, and scaling

Model training with logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests

Evaluation using F1 and AUC-ROC metrics

Class imbalance corrections via both upsampling and downsampling

Selection of best model configuration based on validation performance

Our goal was to provide Beta Bank with a data-driven lens into churn risk—and equip the team to take action before it’s too late.

This project successfully built a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn at Beta Bank, addressing real-world challenges such as class imbalance, model optimization, and reproducibility. After testing multiple models and resampling techniques, the best-performing model was a **downsampled Random Forest classifier**, which achieved an **F1 score of 0.616** on the test set.

Key takeaways:
- Class imbalance had a significant impact on model performance and required careful correction.
- Random Forest models consistently outperformed simpler algorithms like Decision Trees and Logistic Regression.
- Experimenting with both upsampling and downsampling helped validate the robustness of the final approach.

By identifying at-risk customers in advance, Beta Bank can proactively design targeted retention strategies—turning predictive insights into customer loyalty. This project also demonstrates readiness for production-level machine learning workflows with careful attention to data preparation, model evaluation, and iteration.
